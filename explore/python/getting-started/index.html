<p>2021 March - Please note: the following guide is intended for Windows 10 computers and laptops.</p><br />

<h1>Download python onto your computer </h1>
<p>To run python scripts directly from your own computer, you'll need to download the latest version of python through their official website at: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/</p>
<p>In this example, and throughout the rest of the python material, I'll be using Python 3.7</p>
<p>Before moving on, if you would like to quickly test one line of python code on your computer,</p>
<p>Press your windows key or use the search bar, type in <b>Python 3.7</b></p>
<p>Click on the python app that pops up. It should open a window that looks something like this:</p>
<p>This is NOT your computer's command line! It may look like it, but notice the name at the top. This is your Python 3.7 app.</p>
<p>Next, let's try making it print "Hello, world!".</p>
<p>This is what you should see!</p>
<p>Okay, awesome. Moving onto the next step...</p>

<h1>Downloading a python IDE onto your computer </h1>
<p>Having an IDE makes coding easier, especially for a beginner. The simplest (and free) python IDE to use is the Wing 101 Python IDE. There are other options, such as Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code), Spyder, etc.<br />
   Of course, you do not have to download an IDE to write a basic python script. You can write a .py (python) script in your preferred way, then run your .py file in command line.<br />
   For simplicity sake, I will show you how to download and use Wing 101 to write and run your python code.<br /></p>
<p>You can find the latest version of Wing 101 Python IDE from their official website at: https://wingware.com/downloads/wing-101</p>
<p>To find Wing 101 on your computer, press your windows key and type in <b>Wing 101</b> into the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you find it, click on it to open, and you should see this window:</p>
<p>Awesome! Now, let's try making it print "Hello, world!".</p>
<p>To do this quickly, let's type it in this box:</p>
<p>And voila!</p>

<h1>Your first python script</h1>
<p>What if...instead of typing in</p>
<div class ="codeCode">
  <p>print("Hello, world!")</p>
</div>
<p>Every time you wanted to see "Hello, world!", all you had to do was press a button?</p>
<p>This is where scripts come in handy. <br />
  Think of scripts as a way to store all the instructions you want to feed to your computer in one place. <br />
  So instead of giving it one instruction at a time, you could give it a list of things to do and have it read them by itself. That's a lot faster, isn't it?<br />
</p>
<p>Let's try doing what we just did, but this time, we'll write it in a <b>script</b></p>
