              <p>What are the chances? Uncertainty follows travellers on their journey.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>An event can be composed of one (ie. elementary event) or multiple outcomes. Outcomes are results that cannot be decomposed into sub-events. A random experiment is where the outcome varies in an unpredictable fashion when repeated.. The set of all possible outcomes is the sample space.<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;"> Sample spaces can be countable (ie. discrete) or continuous</span>.&nbsp;</p>
