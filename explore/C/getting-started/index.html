<p>2021 Sept - Please note: the following guide is intended for Windows 10 computers and laptops.</p><br />

<h1>Download VS 2019 onto your computer </h1>
<p>To write, build, and debug C projects efficiently, I recommend using Microsoft's Visual Studio 2019. You can find this on their official website at: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/</p>
<p>After downloading the installer (.exe), run it.</p>
<p>Next, check the box next to <b>Desktop development with C++</b> and install.</p>

<h1>Your first C code</h1>
<p>Create a source code file called "helloworld.c" and type the following into your source code:</p>
<div class ="codeCode">
  <p>#include <stdio.h> //do this to use some basic functions in C</p>
  <p>int main(){ //this is where your code will start executing from</p>
  <p>printf("Hello, world!"); //display "Hello, world!" on output screen, end your statement with a semi-colon ';'</p>
  <p>return 0; //tells the computer your code ran successfully</p>
  <p>} //close the bracket</p>
</div>
<p>Now, open terminal or Developer, and type</p>
<div class ="codeCode">
  <p>cl helloworld.c</p>
</div>
<p>This will compile your C code. Now you'll want to run, or execute your code to actually see what it does. </br> Type into the terminal:</p>
<div class ="codeCode">
  <p>helloworld</p>
</div>
<p>You should see a screen pop up, with "Hello, world!" printed on it.</p>
</br>
<p><b>Congratulations!</b> You've completed your first C program.</p>
