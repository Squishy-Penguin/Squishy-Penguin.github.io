 <h1> Exploring</h1>

    <p>What are the chances? Uncertainty follows travellers on their journey.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>An event can be composed of one (ie. elementary event) or multiple outcomes. Outcomes are results that cannot be decomposed into sub-events. A random experiment is where the outcome varies in an unpredictable fashion when repeated.. The set of all possible outcomes is the sample space.<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;"> Sample spaces can be countable (ie. discrete) or continuous</span>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Axioms of Probability</p>
    <ul> <!--start of list of axioms of probability-->
    <li>0 &lt;= P[A]</li>
    <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;<span style="color: #808080;">(probability of event A occurring is a non-negative value)</span></span></li>
    </ul>
    <li>P[S] = 1</li>
    <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;(probability of event S, equivalent to the sample space, is one)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li>P[A&rsquo;] = 1 - P[A]</li>
    <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;<span style="color: #808080;">(probability of event A not occurring is the prime of probability of event A occurring)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li>A and B = null -&gt; P[A or B] = P[A] + P[B]</li>
    <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #808080;">(if event A and B are mutually exclusive, then the probability of event A or event B occurring is the sum of the probability of event A, B)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>A, B independent &lt; = -&gt; P[A and B] = P[A]P[B]   </li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #808080;">(events A, B are independent if and only if the probability of event A and B occurring is the product of probability of event A, B)</span></li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>P [A|B] = P[A and B] / P [B]</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #808080;">Conditional probability: probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred is the product of the probability of event A and B occuring, divided by the probability of all instances where event B occurs</span></li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>P [A|B] = P[B and A]P[A]/SUM( all P[B]’s) </li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400; color: #808080;">Baye’s Rule: probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred is the product of the probability of event B and A occuring and probability of event A, divided by the probability of all instances where event B occurs</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Into the forest. In the big green forest, under the big blue sky, lived Small rabbit.</h1>
  
    <p>He had</p>
      <ul> <!--Description of rabbit -->
        <li>gray fur</li>
        <li>black eyes</li>
        <li>big tail</li>
      </ul>
  
    <p>Unfortunately, Small rabbit did not have a home because he never built one. It was cozy sleeping in the roots of trees and lying on top of leaves.>
