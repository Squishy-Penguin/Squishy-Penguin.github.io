# Ingredients
* *Brushing*
* 2 tbsp honey
* 2 tbsp water

* *Marinade*
* 2 tbsp honey
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 4 tbsp white sugar
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tbsp minced garlic
* 1 pinch white pepper
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
* 3 tbsp liquid from fermented red bean curd
* 2 tbsp clear salted rice wine (cooking wine)
* 2 lbs pork shoulder cut (or another mostly lean with some fat cut)

* *Utensils*
* Oven
* Brush
* Oven mittens
* Cooling rack for pan
* Container or zip lock bag
* Baking pan that will fit the pork
* Cutting board for cooked food and knife

# Directions
1. In a container, mix garlic and soy sauces. Add the cooking wine, sugar and pepper. 

2. If you can estimate, add honey and oyster sauce directly to decrease waste and clean-up. Otherwise, just add them normally.

2. Add liquid from fermented bean curd. You can use a spicy flavored one if you'd like. You can also use pieces of bean curd directly, but it's wasteful to use the actual chunks for a baking sauce if you already eat bean curd as its own dish.

3. Mix well. Put pork cut inside container and turn it until it is coated evenly. Do not pre-cut the pork or else it can burn easily later in the oven.

4. Refrigerate overnight, or at least for 8 hours. Do not put it in the freezer or it will solidify.

4. Place the pork it inside a pan that is deep enough so that it can fit completely inside without pieces sticking out from the top. Make sure it won't drip either. Save the marinade.

6. When oven is all clear and safe, adjust to the middle rack. Preheat oven to 400 degrees celsius (mine is electric). 

7. Brush the pork with the marinade. Place it inside the preheated oven.

8. Bake for 25 min, then put on oven mits and remove it. Place it on the cooling rack and brush the pork with the marinade again. 

9. Repeat step #8 once, but this time brush with the brushing mix (honey and water mix).

10. Bake for 10 min, then remove and place it on the cooling rack. Turn oven off. 

11. When it has cooled, place on cutting board and slice into 1/2 inch slices. It's ready to eat!
