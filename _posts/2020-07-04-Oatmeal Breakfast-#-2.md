# Ingredients
* 100mL yogurt
* 1 ripe banana
* 1 cup blueberries
* 1 tablespoon of oatmeal, uncooked
* 125mL tablespoon water
* A bowl
* A spoon
* 1 fruit knife
* A small pot with a lid

# Directions
1. Boil water in a pot. Add oatmeal and cook until oats are soft. 

2. Add blueberries and cook until water turns blue/purple. Then turn off the heat.

2. Pour pot contents into a bowl. Add yogurt and mix lightly until all the watery parts are gone.

3. Peel one side of the banana. Slice the banana into half-inch thick discs.

4. Slide banana discs off of the peel and on top of the yogurt mix in the bowl.

6. It's ready to eat! Mix it before eating to get a even distribution of flavor.
