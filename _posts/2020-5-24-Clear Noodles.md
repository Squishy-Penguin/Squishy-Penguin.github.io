*Ingredients*
* Mung bean noodles
* Sliced onion strips
* Chopped brocolli
* Sliced meat in thin pieces
* Tapioca starch or corn starch
* Minced garlic
* Soy sauce to taste
* Cooking oil
* Pan with lid
* Water
* Any other marinade/sauce you like

**Directions**
1. Boil water in a pot. Add mung bean noodles, cook until soft and ready. Take out, strain, and soak in cold water. 
2. Marinate meat in whatever you like. I used some cooking wine and dry spice. 
3. Stir-fry the onion and brocolli. Scoop up and set aside. 
4. Stir-fry the meat. Scoop up and set aside. 
5. Stir-fry garlic in hot oil on the pan. Then add soy sauce and any other sauce. Add mung bean noodles. 
6. Stir, add water if too dry. Pour meat back into pan and let boil for 2 min. 
7. Add vegetables back into pan. Mix all together and turn off the heat. 
8. Eat while it's hot! If the noodles don't taste strong enough you can add more sauce.
