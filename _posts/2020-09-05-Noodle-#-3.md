  <p>The pork just melts in your mouth and the broth made the noodles extra delicious.</p>
  <p>An electric stove or a slow-cooker can help you save on electricity when making this meal. </p>

# Ingredients
* pork belly, 2 inch x 6 inch (length should fit inside pot)
* 2 tbsp light soy sauce, 1 tsp dark soy sauce
* 3 slices of ginger, sliced into lines
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* water, enough to cover the pork belly's surface when they sit in the pot
* cooking pots with lids
* chopsticks or another long and nimble stirring tool
* noodles
* washed and cut brocolli flowers
* serving bowls

# Directions
1. Add water to the pot until the top half is above or at the pork belly piece. Bring to a boil and add pork belly in.

2. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until all sides of pork belly turn white. Scoop out scum floating at the top of the water and discard. (While it's cooking, mix the rest of the ingredients)

3. Remove blanched pork belly and rinse under cold water. When it is safe to touch, cut into 1 inch thick cubes.

4. Empty the water in the pot. Heat up the pot and add ginger and pork belly cubes. On low-medium heat, let the pork belly simmer until its liquid/oil starts seeping out. Turn it once in a while to prevent its side from getting charred.

5. Pour in the sauce mixture and stir.

6. Lower the heat to the lowest setting and let the pork belly simmer for 2-3 hours or until it is tender.

7. In a separate pot, cook noodles. When they are cooked, strain them and run them through cold water. Serve in bowls.

8. Boil the brocolli flowers. Salt to taste, strain, and remove. Add to bowls of noodles. Pour the soup water into the bowls until they almost cover the surface of the noodles.

9. Place a few cubes of pork belly on top of the noodles in the bowls. Then finish serving by pouring the pan juice from the pork belly on top of the noodles. Happy eating!

9. -OPTIONAL: if it isn't salty enough or you want more "seafood" flavor, you can add soy sauce, oyster sauce, or your own sauce for a stronger taste.
