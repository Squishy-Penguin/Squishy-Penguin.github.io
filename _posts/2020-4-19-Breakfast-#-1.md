*Ingredients*
* 1 tablespoon of oatmeal, uncooked
* 4 tablespoon water
* A spoon
* A bowl
* A small pot with a lid
* 1 cup yogurt
* 1 fruit knife
* 1 ripened kiwi fruit
* 1 slice of another fruit

**Directions**
1. Boil water in a pot. Add oatmeal and cook until oats are soft. Then turn off the heat.
2. Pour pot contents into a bowl. Add yogurt and stir with a spoon. 
3. Peel the kiwi's hairy skin off using the fruit knife. Slice kiwi into round slices about 1/2 cm thick.  
4. Slice the slice of the other fruit into flat triangles. 
5. Place fruit slices on top of the yogurt mix. Arrange it however you like. 
6. It's ready to eat! I like to eat it with the fruit sitting at the top.
