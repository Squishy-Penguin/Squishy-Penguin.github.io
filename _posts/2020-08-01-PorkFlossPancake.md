  <p>I love pork floss. But I don't know how to make it...</p>
</div>

# Ingredients
* non-stick pan & spatula
* mixing bowl & mixing tool
* deep spoon/ladel
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* 220 mL water
* 1 handful of chopped green onions
* 1/4 tsp salt (optional)
* oil
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce (or another sauce you like)
* 1/2 cup pork floss, cooked (mine was store-bought)
* plate

# Directions
1. In a bowl, mix flour, water, and green onions together. The batter should be slightly thick.

2. The oyster sauce can be mixed into the batter or set aside and brushed on the cooked pancakes later.

3. Heat oil in non-stick pan. Using the deep spoon or ladel, add two scoops of batter to the pan.

4. When pancake is no longer sticking to the pan, use the spatula to help flip it over.

5. When the pancake is cooked, drain the excess oil back into the pan, then set the pancake on the plate. If you wanted to brush on the sauce, you can do so now.

6. Continue cooking pancakes until there is no more batter left. Stack the pancake with some pork floss between each layer.

7. To serve, slice the pancake tower as you would for a cake. Happy eating!
