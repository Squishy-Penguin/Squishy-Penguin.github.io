# Ingredients
* kitchen scale
* 35 g rice flour
* 30 g tapioca starch
* 8 g wheat starch
* 120 mL warm water
* 120 mL boiled water (hot!!)
* bowl
* shallow dish/pan
* oil
* steamer rack
* flat spoon/rice paddle 
* a deeper bowl or basin that is larger than the dish/pan

# Directions
1. In a bowl, mix dry ingredients together. Use kitchen scale to measure them. It's important to be accurate.

2. Mix in warm water. then mix in the boiled water. Result: very thin, watery batter.

3. Grease the shallow dish/pan with oil. Add 1-2 ladles of batter (or until surface of dish is covered completely).

4. Steam on medium or high heat for 8 minutes. Remember to add enough water so that the steamer doesn't burn.

5. While waiting for the 8 minutes to pass, fill deep bowl/basin with cold water.

6. Remove dish with tongs and let it float on the cold water in the deep bowl. The contents usually look like a thin pancake with some air bubbles.

7. Using flat rice paddle, carefully flip at the edges. Roll into a flat cylinder.

8. Once all batter has been steamed, it is done and ready to eat!

9. -OPTIONAL: if it tastes bland, you can add soy sauce, sesame sauce, or your own sauce for a stronger taste.
